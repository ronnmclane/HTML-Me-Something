                    <p>I am an ordained Buddhist Monk & Zen Priest.</p>

                    <p>My journey began when my teacher Sunyananda Dharma received an invitation from a Zen Pureland Master in Taiwan.  My teacher was unable to attend a festival at a mountain monestary deep in the heart of Taiwan so he asked me and another monastic to attend in his stead.</p>

                    <p>A few weeks later I found myself boarding a plane and headed to the other side of the planet.  In my mind I was simply open for this adventure.  My head was shaved and I wore the long gray robes that I would be expected to wear during my visit.  </p>

                    <p>We traveled the entire Island of Tiawan over a two week period with a group of Vietnamese Nuns and Lay people.  We toured so many Temples that I actually lost count.</p>

                    <p>I was in continual awe at the grandure of the Temples and Monetaries that we visisted.  </p>

                    <p>The final five days of the journey led us to the the mountain monestary that had originally extended the inviation.  We served as the American delgates to a Buddhist festival and celebration with over 4000 monks and nuns in attendance.</p>
